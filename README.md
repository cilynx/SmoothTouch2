I ran into enough limitations with the current architecture of SmoothTouch, mostly due to the fact that I'm not an Android developer and I suck at this, that it was easier to start over from scratch.  The new tab/fragment based interface is much easier to work with and I've added some rudimentary support for multiple machine profiles.  Most of the guts are still missing right now, so no public release just yet.  Stay tuned.
